# Graphs Transformation Model

This project aims to develop a model for graphs transformation, which predicts the data series represented by four kinds of scientific figures or charts, i.e., bar graphs, dot plots, line graphs, and scatter plots. The project is based on the [Benetech Making Graphs Accessible](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/benetech-making-graphs-accessible/overview/evaluation) competition hosted on the Kaggle platform.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the data series represented by the given charts. The model will be evaluated based on normalized RMSE *(NRMSE)* and normalized Levenshtein distance *(NLev)* metrics.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is provided by the competition and consists of a set of labeled charts. The data training set containins 60_578 labeled examples. The charts are represented as image files in *JPG* format and the labels are in *JSON* format.
